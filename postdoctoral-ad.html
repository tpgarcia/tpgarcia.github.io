		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Postdoctoral Researcher Position:</h3> 
			<p> Prof. Tanya Garcia is currently recruiting a highly motivated and driven Postdoctoral researcher
			with a fresh PhD in Statistics/Biostatistics to join her lab at the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
			</p>
			
<!--			ORIGINAL VERSION

<p>			This position will provide a unique opportunity to be part of an enthusiastic research team working to develop statistical strategies that help researchers estimate, with high accuracy, the disease course for neurodegenerative diseases, so that we may identify when an experimental therapy could best modify the disease course. 			The ideal postdoctoral researcher is expected to function with relative independence and responsibility. The Garcia Lab provides training opportunities so that the postdoctoral researcher can grow their leadership and management skils.
			</p>
			
			<p>
      You, as the ideal postdoctoral researcher, must be respectful, curious and open to feedback; an excellent programmer (experienced in R and GitHub); an excellent communicator (experienced in writing and publishing statistical methods papers, and presenting scientific talks); and you enjoy being the "go-to" person to help lab members. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  You will be responsible for developing and implementing new statistical methods, and testing those methods on our available neurodegenerative disease data sets. You will be responsible for maintaining systems and structures that ensure the methods and results are reproducible. 
			</p>
			

			<p> Due to federally-mandated funding restrictions, the postdoctoral trainee MUST be a US citizen or permanent resident.

<!--	<p>			The postdoctoral researcher will join a research team focused on developing statistical methods that help researchers accurately estimate the disease course for neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate estimates of the disease course can help researchers to  identify when an experimental therapy could modify the disease course and to design a well-powered clinical trial to test that therapy. Our team is dedicated to achieving that goal together by putting systematic plans in place. We believe that a goal without a plan is like a ship without a navigational system. We enjoy connecting with each other and understanding how to tap into our gifts and personalities and align them with the goals we aim to achieve together. We strive to be sensitive to the emotions, behaviors, and tendencies of others, while also holding people to high standards of performance as a way to motivate them. We value tried-and-true solutions but are also willing to deviate from existing rules and traditions to find new answers when necessary.  We use theories and models to solve problems, while also relying on intuition and a process-oriented approach to reach decisions. We hold ourselves accountable for the outcomes we experience, and are eager to receive feedback and other perspectives to grow as a person and as a researcher. </p>-->

<p> The Garcia Lab is proud to have its work funded by an <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5c2oCQzS70CLww9xDjdPRg/project-details/10634043" style="color: #DC143C;">R01 from the National Institutes of Health</a>. The main focus of that R01 and the problem to be tackled by the postdoctoral researcher is the following.
</p>
		
		
			<p> 
			Developing disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is notoriously difficult and is exacerbated by the lack of accurate statistical models to identify the optimal time for intervention.  Models of how symptoms worsen over time---the symptom trajectory---before and after a clinical diagnosis can help identify that optimal time. These models can help pinpoint when  therapies could  prevent a  clinical diagnosis, or slow the disease after a clinical diagnosis.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  			Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy even for Huntington disease, where researchers can track symptoms in patients guaranteed to develop the disease.  Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington disease progresses slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before clinical diagnosis. This makes time to clinical diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient's motor abnormalities will merit a clinical diagnosis sometime after the last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model the symptom trajectory before and after clinical diagnosis without full information about when clinical diagnosis occurs.

<p>
The challenge creates a unique statistical problem of modeling the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-censored covariate,  time to clinical diagnosis. Tackling this problem by modeling  the distribution for time to  clinical diagnosis has long been thought to be the best strategy. For years,  we and others worked to develop reliable  distribution models, but we found that if the model is slightly wrong, we  get biased estimates of how the symptom trajectory changes as a function of time to clinical diagnosis.  The bias results in clinical trials that are incorrectly powered and thus cannot determine with statistical significance if a therapy modifies the disease course.
  </p>

<p>
  By joining the Garcia Lab, you will work with us, side-by-side, to develop a solution that  reliably estimates  the symptom  trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis, even when time to clinical diagnosis is censored and potentially mismodeled. Our goal is to develop methods that protect against mismodeling, so we can help researchers design well-powered clinical trials for these devastating diseases.
