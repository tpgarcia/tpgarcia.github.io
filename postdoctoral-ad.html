		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Postdoctoral Researcher Position:</h3> 
			<p> Dr. Tanya Garcia is seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher with a recent PhD in Statistics or Biostatistics to join her lab in the Department of Biostatistics at UNC-Chapel Hill. The postdoc will receive one-on-one mentorship from Dr. Garcia, a recipient of the 2024 Landis Award for Outstanding Mentorship from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The postdoc will also collaborate closely with Dr. Garcia's long-time colleagues: Dr. Yanyuan Ma, a fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Dr. Karen Marder, a world-renowned expert in neurodegenerative diseases. Learn more about working with this team  <a href="https://tpgarcia.github.io/research-requirements/" style="color: #DC143C;">here</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  This is a 2-year postdoc position with a salary of $65,000/year, along with fringe and benefits.  Applications from all researchers are welcomed, and especially those from underrepresented groups.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Duties and Responsibilities:</h3> 

			<p>  

The postdoc will develop statistical methods and open-source software/tools for a <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5c2oCQzS70CLww9xDjdPRg/project-details/10634043" style="color: #DC143C;">NIH-funded</a> research project that is focused on estimating the disease course for neurodegenerative diseases while bypassing modeling errors. These estimates can help researchers identify when an experimental therapy could slow disease progression and design a well-powered clinical trial to test that therapy. The postdoc will join a team of lab members dedicated to achieving that goal.

<p>The postdoc will write multiple peer-reviewed manuscripts as the first author, present their work at national conferences, and gain leadership and mentoring skills by collaborating with student trainees in the lab.
