		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Postdoctoral Researcher</h3> 
			<p> Prof. Tanya Garcia and Prof. Haibo Zhou are currently recruiting a highly motivated and driven Postdoctoral researcher
			with a fresh PhD in Statistics/Biostatistics to join our team at the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This position will provide a unique opportunity to be part of an enthusiastic research team working towards predicting precise, personalized, and robust progression profiles for neurodegenerative diseases.  The successful candidate will be supervised by Professor Tanya Garcia and Professor Haibo Zhou. The official posting of the job advert can be found <a href="https://unc.peopleadmin.com/postings/173908" style="color: #DC143C;">here</a>.	
	
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Interested candidates must send (1) Curriculum Vitae/Resume and (2) List of 3-4 references (contact information) to tpgarcia[at]stat[dot]tamu[dot]edu. Due to federally-mandated funded restrictions, the postdoctoral trainee MUST be a US citizen or permanent resident.
			</p>


		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Who We Are</h3> 
			<p> Our research goal is to design robust, reliable, and parsimonious disease progression models for Alzheimer's,
			Parkinson's and Huntington disease. We build statistical models using longitudinal imaging data and clinical data about motor, cognitive, functional impairments to predict when significant impairments are likely to occur. Our group has developed semiparametric/nonparametric models
			to develop longitudinal prediction models that identify patient subgroups susceptible to faster motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and regional brain atophy. We also developed variable selection methods to extract maximal information
			from large, highly correlated imaging data  to identify brain regions that could be target regions for
			future clinical trials. See our list of our publications <a href="https://tpgarcia.github.io/publications/" style="color: #DC143C;">here</a>.
			</p>
			
		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Active projects in the Garcia Research Group are focused on addressing the following questions:</h3> 
			<ol>
			  <li> how can we identify patient subgroups with distinct cognitive decline and regional brain atrophy when data is collected from individuals with different disease severity levels but without clear markers for their exact severity level?</li>
			  
			  <li> how can we predict an individual's expected  disease progression pattern when there is substantial missing data?</li>
			  
			  <li> how can we predict significant cognitive decline from high-dimensional imaging data and develop robust inferential tools?</li>
			</ol>			


		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Who You Are</h3>
		  The ideal candidate is someone who is
			<ol>
				<li> Enthusiastic about learning new statistical techniques that can be applied to solve real-world problems.
				</li> 
				<li> Highly motivated to pursue and establish a career in research.</li>
        <li> Inspired to make a difference in the field.</li>
        <li> Highly enthusiastic to seek answers and explanations.</li>

				<li> Open to learning about yourself and your strengths and weaknesses.
				<li> Ready to hear about and overcome any patterns that interfere with your productivity and growth 
					as a person and scientist.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Values in Our Research Group:</h3> 
			<p> This research group values creativity, fun, personal growth and fulfillment, integrity, and trust.  
			</p>	
			
				<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Who should not apply:</h3> 
				The position is not a good fit for someone who:

				<li> Does not like improving oneself. </li>
				<li> Needs constant motivation and guidance. </li>
				<li> Not receptive to constructive criticism. </li>
				<li> Looking for an easy research project -- developing high quality research takes time and patience. </li>
				<li> Not detail-oriented. </li>
				<li> Does not take responsibility for their actions and progress. </li>
				<li> Does not want to pursue a career in research.</li>
