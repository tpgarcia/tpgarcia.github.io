		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Postdoctoral Researcher:</h3> 
			<p> Prof. Tanya Garcia is currently recruiting a highly motivated and driven Postdoctoral researcher
			with a fresh PhD in Statistics/Biostatistics to join her lab at the Department of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This position will provide a unique opportunity to be part of an enthusiastic research team working towards predicting precise, personalized, and robust progression profiles for neurodegenerative diseases.  	

			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Interested candidates must upload their (1) Curriculum Vitae/Resume and (2) List of 3-4 references (contact information) <a href="https://unc.peopleadmin.com/postings/173908" style="color: #DC143C;">here</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			  
			   Due to federally-mandated funded restrictions, the postdoctoral trainee MUST be a US citizen or permanent resident.
			  
			</p>


		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Who We Are:</h3> 
			<p> Our research goal is to design robust, reliable, and parsimonious disease progression models for Huntington and Alzheimer disease. We build statistical models using longitudinal data about motor, cognitive, functional impairments to predict when significant impairments are likely to occur. Our group 
			
			has developed semiparametric/nonparametric models
			to develop longitudinal prediction models that are robust to modeling errors. We also developed variable selection methods to extract maximal information
			from large, highly correlated imaging data  to identify brain regions that could be target regions for
			future clinical trials. See our list of our publications <a href="https://tpgarcia.github.io/publications/" style="color: #DC143C;">here</a>.
			</p>
			
		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Active projects in the Garcia Research Group are focused on addressing the following questions:</h3> 
			<ol>
			  <li> how can we identify patient subgroups with distinct cognitive decline and regional brain atrophy when data is collected from individuals with different disease severity levels but without clear markers for their exact severity level?</li>
			  
			  <li> how can we predict an individual's expected  disease progression pattern when there is substantial missing data?</li>
			  
			  <li> how can we predict significant cognitive decline from high-dimensional imaging data and develop robust inferential tools?</li>
			</ol>			

			<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Values in Our Research Group:</h3> 
			This research group 
				<ol>
				  <li> Believes success in a research career can be attributed to different skillsets, and those skillsets can be learned through deliberate practice.</li>
				  
				  <li> Strives for producing improved iterations of a project rather than striving for perfection. </li>
				  
				  <li> Evaluates their performance with honesty and curiosity to identify and remedy habits that are hindering their success.</li>
				  
				  <li> Identifies the fun in mastering a new skillset, and actively does regular self-care to sustain their energy level and health.</li>
				</ol>
