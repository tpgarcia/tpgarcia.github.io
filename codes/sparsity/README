Codes for ``Identification of Important Regressor Groups, Subgroups, and Individuals via Regularization Methods: 
Application to Gut Microbiome Data''

1. simulations : directory containing simulation study
(a). simulations.R : main file to run study. This is set up to run 1 simulation for the proposed algorithm, with 2 repeated 10-fold cross validations. In the manuscript, we run 100 repeats of cross-validation.

(b). This folder also already contains the output that simulations.R will generate. Look at simulations.Rout for a summary of the results.

2. Cpp_code: directory of C++ codes
(a). mylin.dll: executable file made from subgSGL.cpp; this is used to run C++ code in R

(b). subSGL.cpp : C++ code of proposed algorithm in Section 2.2.1




3. main: directory of R codes used to run simulations
(a). main_code.R : main functions used by the simulation study including the seven variable selection techniques
      proposed in the paper.

(b). simulation_study_common_parameters.R: contains parameters used in simulation study.

(c). simulation_study_main_sub_group.R : function setup to run the simulation study.

(d). call_simulation_study.R : function that calls simulations study

(e). subgroup_SGL.R : R code that calls C++ implementation (subSGL.cpp) of proposed algorithm in Section 2.2.1

(f). mySGLcode.R : version of Simon et al.~(2012) code

(g). simulation_study_table_results.R : output from simulation study
