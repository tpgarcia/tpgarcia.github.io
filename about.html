		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Tanya P. Garcia, Ph.D.</h3>
		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Associate Professor, Department of Biostatistics, UNC Chapel Hill </h3>


	<p>Born in Lima, Peru, and raised in San Jose, California, Dr. Tanya Garcia fondly remembers spending her days as a 4-year-old craftily fitting together the pieces of jigsaw puzzles. Years later, in university, puzzles took a new shape and her enthusiasm for solving mathematical and statistical problems blossomed. Dr. Garcia pursued theoretical and applied statistical graduate training at Texas A&M University and discovered a genuine excitement for developing statistical models that correctly model the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington and Alzheimer disease. Her work is published in top statistical journals such as Journal of the American Statistical Association and Annals of Applied Statistics, and she has earned multiple, competitive grants, fellowships, and awards, including from the Huntingtonâ€™s Disease Society of America and National Institutes of Health. Now as a tenured, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at UNC Chapel Hill, Dr. Garcia is passionate about mentoring trainees to embrace a growth mindset that empowers them to tackle any and all obstacles without judgement or fear. Ultimately, she wants every team member to achieve personal and professional success alongside fulfilment, and that desire drives all her leadership decisions.
