		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Tanya P. Garcia, Ph.D.</h3>
		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Director of the MIND Lab, Associate Professor, Department of Biostatistics, UNC-Chapel Hill </h3>


	<p>As a child--born in Lima, Peru and raised in San Jose, California--I loved fitting together jigsaw puzzles for hours. Years later, at university, my love for puzzles took new shape in the form of solving statistical problems. Once, as an undergraduate student, a professor challenged me to model the infection rate of a disease among a population. On my short drive home from Irvine to Costa Mesa, California, I began iterating through different solutions in my head. I was so fixated on solving the problem, I became oblivious to the road signs and only two hours later realized I had driven to Los Angeles! At that moment, I knew I wanted a career in statistics.</p>
   
   <p>I pursued graduate statistics training at Texas A&M University, where I discovered a genuine excitement for accurately modeling the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s. As a faculty member, I combined that excitement for modeling with my interest in career coaching to train the next generation of (bio)statisticians to confidently develop and test models for clinical use.    How I mentor this next generation is not only motivated by 500+ hours of leadership training, but also by my experiences as one of the few Hispanic, female biostatisticians. I teach my lab members to embrace a growth mindset and tackle obstacles without judgment or fear. My desire for every lab member to achieve success and fulfillment drives my every leadership decision. These decisions have led to earning multiple grants from the National Institutes of Health and my trainees nominating me for the 2022 Carolina Women’s Leadership Council Faculty Mentoring Award and  the 2024 Landis Mentoring Award for Outstanding Mentorship from the National Institutes of Health--two awards I received and consider as my most prestigious accomplishments.  Outside of UNC, I lead initiatives for national statistics organizations that foster the success of underrepresented and early career (bio)statisticians.
