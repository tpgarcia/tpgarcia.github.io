		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Tanya P. Garcia, Ph.D.</h3>
		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Associate Professor, Department of Statistics </h3>


	<p>Excited about innovating practical and theoretically sound methods that address challenges in biomedical fields, 
	Dr. Garcia has built a strong interdisciplinary research agenda. It involves national and international collaborations 
	with neuroscientists and biologists, high-impact learning opportunities for students, and service work
that promotes a future of diverse (bio)statisticians. Her research focuses on extracting maximal information from large, 
	highly correlated data structures and has led to scientific discoveries in neurodegenerative
diseases and the gut microbiome. Her teaching integrates these research activities with interactive, learner-centered 
	projects that promote critical thinking. Her leadership in service activities involves promoting the
success of underrepresented groups in (bio)statistics and providing her professional expertise regionally and
internationally.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>Dr. Garcia's research has attracted over $900,000 in competitive funding as Principal
Investigator including grants from the NIH National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)
and Huntington's Disease Society of America. She  publishes at a rate of 3 papers per year in top statistics journals
including Journal of the American Statistical Association, Annals of Applied Statistics, and Bioinformatics.
Her work is cited (inter)nationally by scholars in United States, France, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada,
among others. She has earned competitive awards including the 2017-2018 NINDS Mentoring Institute for
Neuroscience Diversity Scholars Fellowship; a fully-funded, visiting scholar invitation to the University of
Sydney in 2012; and the 2011 American Statistical Association Gertrude M. Cox Award (awarded to two
of 1200 applicants in North America). She has presented in over 35 invited department seminars and invited
(inter)national conference sessions (rate of 5 per year).
	    </p>
	    
	    <p> Her research innovates new statistical methods that solve important neuroscience and
		    biomedical problems and advances the underlying theory of those methods. Her work has
contributed to four exciting areas: prediction models, model selection for high-dimensional data, regression models with measurement error,
		    mean-covariance modeling for longitudinal data.
