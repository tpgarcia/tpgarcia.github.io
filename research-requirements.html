					Hands-on bench work: We usually start showing you and training you in hands-on bench work, which includes but is not limited to: inducing brain injury in mice, maintenance and genotyping of transgenic animal colonies, brain tissue processing, immunohistochemistry, cell culture, confocal imaging, and image analysis. We typically assign a small research project to undergraduate students, sometimes we do this during the first semester that you are with us, sometimes for the summer/semester after. Yes, you will participate in real research. We don't have "practice projects" here. The exact nature of this project depends on what we are working on at the moment and how quickly you pick up the techniques required.

 

2). Proper scientific practice: Experimental design, ethical conduct and organization of research work is geared at maximizing the quality of our work and productivity. You will -with our help- design your experiment, carry out the work, analyze the data and make them presentable. Once you have these steps down you’re ready for graduate school. 

 

3). The scientific background of our research work: You will learn about the function of astrocytes and other glial cells in the brain. How these functions change after injury and what tools and techniques we can use to answer research questions.

 

4). Personal development work: Our team meets once a month for a full day to work on ourselves. We explore what our individual strengths and weaknesses are and how these help or hinder our individual happiness and productivity. This helps us to get to know each other at a deeper level and to operate powerfully as a team.

			I will wear many “hats” in our relationship, which could include mentor, teacher, employer, and collaborator.  This can be a rich, but sometimes complicated, relationship, as it can be my job to provide you with advice, support, and sometimes a kick in the pants if things aren’t going as planned.  In trying to meet these various roles, I do my best to try to maintain open communication, providing both positive (to avoid you feeling unappreciated) and negative (to avoid “big blowups”) feedback on a regular basis.  I am happy to think together with you about both professional and work-life balance issues.  At time same time, however, at this stage in your career, I think you need me to be a reasonably objective mentor more than you need me to be your friend, so there may be issues that you should be taking to other students/postdocs or people outside of the field to think through.    It is important to note that different mentors in this department take vastly different approaches to working with their students- it is often NOT helpful to compare what you are receiving compared to what others in your cohort are receiving. It is more to your benefit to think critically about what your own strengths and weaknesses are, what kind of mentorship will propel you to achieve your goals, and to communicate challenges if necessary.
