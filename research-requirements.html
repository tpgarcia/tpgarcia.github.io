			<h4 class="title" style="color: #800000;"><a href="#">Opportunities Provided from this Group</a></h4> 
							We are a fun research team that is focused on helping junior statisticians
			reach for excellence and independence.

			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Rigorous statistical theory motivated by real applications:</strong> All of the problems we work on
				are motivated by real applications, particularly related to neurodegenerative diseases. You will be 
					trained in developing new statistical techniques that solve these problems
					and trained in developing rigorous statistical theory to support those techniques.
					
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Valuable coding:</strong> You will be trained in implementing the developed methodology
					into R/Matlab/C++/Fortran
					coding that is well-documented, efficient, organized, and of practical value to other statisticians.
					All coding will be made available via Github or CRAN.
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Persuasive writing & presentation skills:</strong> You will be trained in developing
					clear, concise, and convincing communication skills (e.g., writing, public speaking) that can
					be understood by statisticians and non-statisticians. 
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Energy management:</strong> You will be trained in developing productivity skills that
					align with your energy levels to produce high-quality work. Most students believe they "work hard"
					because they are putting in many hours and staying up late to work on research/homework.
					Rather than putting in long hours, you will be trained to improve your focus and work on 
					the right problems in shorter, focused, deep sessions.
				</li> 
				<li> <strong>Personal improvement:</strong> Our team meets once a month for a full day to work on ourselves. We explore what our individual strengths and weaknesses are and how these help or hinder our individual happiness and productivity. This helps us to get to know each other at a deeper level and to operate powerfully as a team.
