			I will wear many “hats” in our relationship, which could include mentor, teacher, employer, and collaborator.  This can be a rich, but sometimes complicated, relationship, as it can be my job to provide you with advice, support, and sometimes a kick in the pants if things aren’t going as planned.  In trying to meet these various roles, I do my best to try to maintain open communication, providing both positive (to avoid you feeling unappreciated) and negative (to avoid “big blowups”) feedback on a regular basis.  I am happy to think together with you about both professional and work-life balance issues.  At time same time, however, at this stage in your career, I think you need me to be a reasonably objective mentor more than you need me to be your friend, so there may be issues that you should be taking to other students/postdocs or people outside of the field to think through.    It is important to note that different mentors in this department take vastly different approaches to working with their students- it is often NOT helpful to compare what you are receiving compared to what others in your cohort are receiving. It is more to your benefit to think critically about what your own strengths and weaknesses are, what kind of mentorship will propel you to achieve your goals, and to communicate challenges if necessary.
