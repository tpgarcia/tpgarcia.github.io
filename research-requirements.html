				<li> It takes you 3 days to respond to an email. </li>
				<li> You begin projects at the last minuse. </li>
				<li> You prefer thinking over doing. </li>
				<li> You don't like improving yourself. </li>
				<li> You need constant motivation and guidance. (I will support you, but you need to be self-motivated). </li>

			<h4 class="title" style="color: #800000;"><a href="#">Opportunities Provided from this Group</a></h4> 
							We are a fun research team that is focused on helping junior statisticians
			reach for excellence and independence.

			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Rigorous statistical theory motivated by real applications:</strong> All of the problems we work on
				are motivated by real applications, particularly related to neurodegenerative diseases. You will be 
					trained in developing new statistical techniques that solve these problems
					and trained in developing rigorous statistical theory to support those techniques.
					
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Valuable coding:</strong> You will be trained in implementing the developed methodology
					into R/Matlab/C++/Fortran
					coding that is well-documented, efficient, organized, and of practical value to other statisticians.
					All coding will be made available via Github or CRAN.
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Persuasive writing & presentation skills:</strong> You will be trained in developing
					clear, concise, and convincing communication skills (e.g., writing, public speaking) that can
					be understood by statisticians and non-statisticians. 
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Energy management:</strong> You will be trained in developing productivity skills that
					align with your energy levels to produce high-quality work. Most students believe they "work hard"
					because they are putting many hours and staying up late to work on research/homework.
					Rather than putting in long hours, you will be trained to improve your focus and work on 
					the right problems in shorter, focused, deep sessions.
				</li> 
				<li> <strong>Personal improvement:</strong> Our team meets once a month for a full day to work on ourselves. We explore what our individual strengths and weaknesses are and how these help or hinder our individual happiness and productivity. This helps us to get to know each other at a deeper level and to operate powerfully as a team.
				</li>
					

 

2). Proper scientific practice: Experimental design, ethical conduct and organization of research work is geared at maximizing the quality of our work and productivity. You will -with our help- design your experiment, carry out the work, analyze the data and make them presentable. Once you have these steps down you’re ready for graduate school. 

 

3). The scientific background of our research work: You will learn about the function of astrocytes and other glial cells in the brain. How these functions change after injury and what tools and techniques we can use to answer research questions.

 

4). Personal development work: Our team meets once a month for a full day to work on ourselves. We explore what our individual strengths and weaknesses are and how these help or hinder our individual happiness and productivity. This helps us to get to know each other at a deeper level and to operate powerfully as a team.

			I will wear many “hats” in our relationship, which could include mentor, teacher, employer, and collaborator.  This can be a rich, but sometimes complicated, relationship, as it can be my job to provide you with advice, support, and sometimes a kick in the pants if things aren’t going as planned.  In trying to meet these various roles, I do my best to try to maintain open communication, providing both positive (to avoid you feeling unappreciated) and negative (to avoid “big blowups”) feedback on a regular basis.  I am happy to think together with you about both professional and work-life balance issues.  At time same time, however, at this stage in your career, I think you need me to be a reasonably objective mentor more than you need me to be your friend, so there may be issues that you should be taking to other students/postdocs or people outside of the field to think through.    It is important to note that different mentors in this department take vastly different approaches to working with their students- it is often NOT helpful to compare what you are receiving compared to what others in your cohort are receiving. It is more to your benefit to think critically about what your own strengths and weaknesses are, what kind of mentorship will propel you to achieve your goals, and to communicate challenges if necessary.
