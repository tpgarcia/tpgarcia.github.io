		<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Overview</h3> 
			<p> I am excited that you are considering to join the MIND lab. Please review our 
			<a href="../../images/Team-Values2.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #DC143C;">lab values</a> and 
			<a href="../../images/working-with-me2.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #DC143C;">this document</a>
				to gain an understanding of how I train mentees. A brief highlight of qualities I am looking for are listed below.
			</p>



<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">The MIND lab is a great fit if you are (or are actively working on becoming)...</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Enthusiastic about learning and applying new statistical techniques to real-world problems. </li>
  <li> Open to understanding and improving your strengths and weaknesses. </li>
  <li> Ready to identify and overcome patterns that may hinder your productivity and growth. </li>
  <li> Self-motivated and driven to succeed. </li>
  <li> Able to work independently after an initial training period. </li>
  <li> A quick learner. </li>
  <li> Results-oriented and focused on outcomes. </li>
  <li> A critical thinker. </li>
  <li> Organized and detail-oriented. </li>
  <li> Committed to maintaining high research standards. </li>
  <li> An excellent communicator. </li>
</ol>
			
				<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">"The MIND lab is unlikely to be the right fit if..."</h3> 
			<ol>
  <li> You start projects at the last minute. </li>
  <li> You prefer thinking over taking action. </li>
  <li> You are not focused on self-improvement. </li>
  <li> You are not open to constructive feedback. </li>
  <li> You dismiss feedback without thoughtful consideration. </li>
  <li> You need constant motivation and guidance (support is provided, but self-motivation is key). </li>
  <li> You are seeking an easy research project â€” high-quality research requires time and iteration. </li>
  <li> You lack attention to detail. </li>
  <li> You avoid taking responsibility for your actions and progress. </li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Opportunities Provided from this Group</h3> 
							We are a fun research team that is focused on helping junior statisticians
			reach for excellence and independence.

			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Rigorous statistical theory motivated by real applications:</strong> All of the problems we work on
				are motivated by real applications, particularly related to neurodegenerative diseases. You will be 
					trained in developing new statistical techniques that solve these problems
					and trained in developing rigorous statistical theory to support those techniques.
					
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Valuable coding:</strong> You will be trained in implementing the developed methodology
					into R/Matlab/C++/Fortran
					coding that is well-documented, efficient, organized, and of practical value to other statisticians.
					All coding will be made available via Github or CRAN.
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Persuasive writing & presentation skills:</strong> You will be trained in developing
					clear, concise, and convincing communication skills (e.g., writing, public speaking) that can
					be understood by statisticians and non-statisticians. 
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Productivity and Creativity:</strong> You will be trained in developing skills that improve your productivity  and creativity
					to help you produce enjoyable and high-quality work.
				</li> 
				<li> <strong>Professional development:</strong> Our team meets once a month to discuss and learn strategies
					that impact our overall well-being, both personally and professionally. This involves exploring any blocks in our mindset, habits, and work 
					strategies that limit our creativity. These monthly sessions also help us to get to know each other better on a personal level and 
					support each other as a team.
				</li>
