<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Opportunities Provided by the MIND Lab</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Skills to generate original ideas:</strong> As biostatisticians, we're often seeking to create original research, the kind that breaks away from the default in favor of better alternatives. By its very nature, original research involves tackling problems with no immediate solutions. How to even start tackling the problem is challenging. In the MIND lab, we promote using a “beginner’s mindset.” With beginner’s mindset, we approach the problem with the attitude of: I don’t know that much. I’m just going to keep asking questions until the problem is clear. Beginner’s mindset is not a call to abandon expertise; rather, it’s an invitation to stay curious. To ask any and all questions, no matter  how basic. Asking “basic” questions is scary and uncomfortable, especially in academia where many of us feel pressured to impress others with our expertise. The MIND lab is a space where we can ask questions without fear of ridicule or judgment. We encourage lab members to ask for help and clarification, offer solutions to problems, admit errors, raise concerns, disagree, and give and receive feedback. We believe these behaviors are essential to generating the original ideas that push science forward.  </li>
  
  
  
  <li> <strong>Skills to create rigorous and impactful science:</strong> After a potential original ideas is identified, I work with lab members  side-by-side to make  their solution rigorous in two ways.  The first is to verify that their solution works  in theory: they write out the solution with statistical models and then use statistical theory to check what properties are and are not guaranteed.  The second is to test their solution with simulation studies, checking different simulation  settings so as to not  cherry-pick those in which the solution works and ignore the ones where it does not. Afterwards, lab members then learn to implement their work in open source  code in the lab's GitHub repository, which is managed by  version control software, and designed for easy use by statisticians and clinician  scientists.   </li>
  
  <li><strong>Skills for effective communication:</strong> Another part of moving science forward is communicating it effectively.  Biostatistics is known for its complexity. We’re responsible for helping researchers design studies, assess data quality, choose appropriate analysis methods, and correctly interpret results. We therefore must be able to articulate complex topics in ways that people of different backgrounds or areas of expertise can understand.  After four years of intensive grantsmanship training, I believe I’ve found a repeatable process to best communicate our science. The premise for that process rests on three key principles: desire, trust, and simplicity. We have to identify what the field wants to solve--creating the desire---and what evidence the field needs to be convinced of a solution---generating trust. And we have to communicate that desire and trust in the simplest way possible. I’ve found these three principles—desire, trust, simplicity—so helpful that I developed a training I call “Create Spicy Science” that teaches these concepts to other biostatisticians. The training includes modules to help biostatisticians identify gaps in the field, create novel ideas to fill those gaps, persuasively write arguments, and communicate feedback effectively and non-confrontationally. Many trainees have used  the skills acquired from the “Create Spicy Science” training to obtain fellowships, travel awards, academic faculty positions, and more. So far, the running total number of achievements from 35 researchers is 70 and counting.   </li>

<li><strong>Environment that supports sustainable growth:</strong> 
Research  has shown that generating original ideas relies more on building ``character skills'' than just accumulating more technical skills (Grant, 2023, Hidden potential: the science of achieving greater things). Often labeled as ``soft skills,'' character skills  are the dedication, determination, and proactiveness to seek new knowledge---the very skills that fuel originality. The MIND lab is a place where character skills are developed through monthly training sessions to help trainees sharpen their research skills in a sustainable and effective way.  Past sessions have included, for example,  strategies to address mental blocks, improve time management, and increase confidence.  </li>


<li><strong>Environment that promotes authenticity:</strong> Psychologists have long recognized that the desires to be one’s authentic self and to fit into a group—to be unique and to belong—are two primal human needs. These needs are so important that the pain from social exclusion causes the same areas of the brain to light up as does physical pain. Uniqueness and belonging are also essential for trainees  to feel included at work. In the MIND lab, we prioritize creating a space for everyone to fit in no matter their individual differences.  We encourage lab members to raise ideas that may be considered unpopular, have fruitful dissension, and, when possible, arrange seating in a circle to encourage interaction and reduce power hierarchy.
