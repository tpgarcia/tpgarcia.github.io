			<h3 class="title" style="color: #800000;">Opportunities Provided from this Group</h3> 
							We are a fun research team that is focused on helping junior statisticians
			reach for excellence and independence.

			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Rigorous statistical theory motivated by real applications:</strong> All of the problems we work on
				are motivated by real applications, particularly related to neurodegenerative diseases. You will be 
					trained in developing new statistical techniques that solve these problems
					and trained in developing rigorous statistical theory to support those techniques.
					
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Valuable coding:</strong> You will be trained in implementing the developed methodology
					into R/Matlab/C++/Fortran
					coding that is well-documented, efficient, organized, and of practical value to other statisticians.
					All coding will be made available via Github or CRAN.
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Persuasive writing & presentation skills:</strong> You will be trained in developing
					clear, concise, and convincing communication skills (e.g., writing, public speaking) that can
					be understood by statisticians and non-statisticians. 
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Productivity and Creativity:</strong> You will be trained in developing skills that improve your productivity  and creativity
					to help you produce enjoyable and high-quality work.
				</li> 
				<li> <strong>Professional development:</strong> Our team meets once a month to discuss and learn strategies
					that impact our overall well-being, both personally and professionally. This involves exploring any blocks in our mindset, habits, and work 
					strategies that limit our creativity. These monthly sessions also help us to get to know each other better on a personal level and 
					support each other as a team.
				</li>
